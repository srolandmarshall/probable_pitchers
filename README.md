# Probable Pitcher Streamer

Probable Pitchers is a stupid ruby app I made to automatically launch my league's probable pitchers

## Installation

download it
unzip it
open your terminal (space+command and type `terminal` if you don't know what this means)
type `cd` then drag the folder to your terminal window 
`bundle install`, i think?
you probably need ruby. you're on your own from here.

## Usage

really has no use for any other human besides those in my league.

## Contributing

I want to make this able to take in a league URL and then work for any league. If you find this and I haven't done it yet, I'll give you $20 to do it.
