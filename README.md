# Probable Pitcher Streamer

Probable Pitchers is a stupid ruby app I made to automatically launch my league's probable pitchers

## Installation

`bundle install`, i think?
you probably need ruby.

## Usage

really has no use for any other human besides those in my league.

## Contributing

I want to make this able to take in a league URL and then work for any league. If you find this and I haven't done it yet, I'll give you $20 to do it.
