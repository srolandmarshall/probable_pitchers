# Probable Pitcher Streamer

Probable Pitchers is a stupid ruby app I made to automatically launch my league's probable pitchers

## Installation

1. download it
1. unzip it
1. open your terminal (space+command and type `terminal` if you don't know what this means)
1. type `cd` then drag the folder to your terminal window 
1. `bundle install`, i think? you probably need ruby. you're on your own if you get an error here. maybe try `gem install bundler` first, if it didn't work. 
1. if the above worked, type `ruby main.rb` and i think it should do everything.

## Usage

really has no use for any other human besides those in my league, right now.

# Commands:
* today: for today's pitchers
* player: gets tomorrows names, lets you launch their page
* tomorrow: for more options on tomorrow's pitchers, such as:
    * tomorrows links: will launch all the probable pitchers profiles at once in your browser (don't do this unless you can handled like 20 tabs opening at once)
    * tomorrows names: just their names
* exit: exits

follow other prompts as necessary.

## Contributing

I want to make this able to take in a league URL and then work for any league. If you find this and I haven't done it yet, I'll give you $20 to do it.

I also want to make this work with Yahoo's fantasy sports API. Combining the above with that should make us able to find probable pitchers into the future that are also Free Agents.
